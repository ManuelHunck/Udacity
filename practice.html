    <b> 
     The <span style="color:blue">World Wide Web</span> 
   </b>
  </p>
<p>
  First we got an small introduction about the area we are later working in - <em>THE Internet</em>.
  Basically we have specialized hardware which is storing the data placed around the globe called <b>servers</b> and personal hardware (PC, Smartphone, eg)to access content from the servers by calling a <b>url</b> (example) with an <b>browser</b> using <b>HTTP Requests</b>
</p>
<b> HTML Basics</b>
<p>
  HTML documents are the documents you find most in the world wide web , they contain content which can be manipulated in different ways to be nocely displayed e.g..
  The elements can be displayed in various ways or can even be used in various ways by using HTML tags.
  Important for their usage is to look twice at them or better even test you output since a computer will only do what you have been coding.
</p>
<b>Elements we encountered in this lesson</b>
<br>
<br>
<em>Inline Elements</em>
<p>
  Inline elements typically may only contain text and other inline elements. When rendered visually, inline elements do not usually begin on a new lin
</p>
<em>Block Elements</em>
<p>
  Block Elements are working as a box around text content for example
</p>
<b>Tags in general</b>
<p>
  Since there are a lot Tag that could be used it is important to know that you can't know everything or may forgot also stuff. 
  So when u want to use Tags for example may check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> <b>w3schools</b> </a> as a surce mentioned due the course.
</p>
<!-- I haven't really noted down a lot but i hope that the usage of what i learned may show that i got the rough idea 
idea would be to put this for later usage with more informations may to a private repository on github-->
